## Instructions for Advanced Users

If you're comfortable setting things up on your own, follow these steps:

**Before starting, go to the releases section and download the "Gamedisk Base.zip" file. Extract it so you have a "Gamedisk Base" folder ready.**

Note: Make sure to add your steamgriddb API key in: `scripts\getallcaptures.py`

1. **Launch the Application**:
   - Run `launcher.bat` to open the application and search for HackDrive's GameDrives.

2. **Downloading Games**:
   - To download games, use the "Download Game" option.

   - **Important**: Do not extract the games yourself; use the `ADD GAMES TO GAMEDRIVES.bat` script to handle this for you.
